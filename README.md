#                *******************************************************
For elite PC gamers who need a boost in performance. See your computer's true power level unrestricted by under-the-hood windows apps that silently eat CPU and RAM.
Lowers input lag in FPS games drastically, reduces cpu to zero, breaks every moving thing windows has under its hood forever.

## Run A1.bat with NSUDO.exe or open !A1KITNSUDO.bat

WARNING: Breaks start menu, makes windows take a minute to start up. Breaks copy and paste, you must drag items between two open folders only to copy or move if it's on the same drive. Makes every explorer folder opened to another window unless you use the navigation bar. Breaks installing drivers, make sure you install all your drivers before using this script. Breaks modern ui settings. Make sure you do those before you use this script. Use SSSERV.BAT to disable services by group to isolate any problems caused. It will run on its own at the end anyway. I have had very minimal issues using these scripts with https://archive.org/details/micro-10-pro-22-h-2-19045.3086_202306

If anyone has a clean windows 22H2 image, I would like to see it for my work and to ensure my work is done on a safe iso. Scripts run best after W10privacy, Blackbird, and Oosu10, which are included. Breaks webcams but not microphones. Breaks most shortcuts to basic rundll windows settings, but they can be opened with batch files which I've included. Shortcuts can be created with right click drag and copypaste occasionally works when between folders of two different drives. Can't do internet changes or ipconfig really so make sure your net is set right before you do this. Odin included for disk imaging, and Nirsoft RegistryChangesView (Rcv.exe) to backup registry as most changes are done there. Scripts are fixed to run individually. if something broke and you want to isolate the problem. By individually I mean that if something is disabled or renamed, anything that depended on it is disabled in the same script.

Netprofm and Netman service can be turned back on though there is not much in there but displays the network connection and advanced adapter properties doesn't show anything, so you must install your lan card and hold down windows key + R, and type ncpa.cpl in the run prompt where you can remove everything except microsoft network and tcpip4. In the properties of tcpip4 and I can't regedit script this for you, you will find an advanced options button on the first tab shown for the advanced settings tcpip4. disable netbios and WINS to finish closing all of your network ports, enabling True Gaming Mode. Windows control panel type shortcuts are in the SHORT folder or you can google rundll 32 shortcut list and make them yourself. Most often breaks the taskbar from showing what apps are open but you can still alt tab. Sometimes it comes back.

Set all your file assoications and install all your drivers and do all your modern ui windows settings before doing this as well as any changers to ncpa.cpl.
