WARNING: breaks start menu, makes windows take a minute to start up, breaks copy and paste, you must drag items between two open folders only to copy or move if it's on the same drive, makes every explorer folder opened to another window unless you use the navigation bar. breaks installing drivers, make sure you install all your drivers before using this script. breaks modern ui settings. make sure you do those before you use this script. use SSSERV.BAT to disable services by group to isolate any problems caused. i have had very minimal issues using these scripts with https://archive.org/details/micro-10-pro-22-h-2-19045.3086_202306 if anyone has a clean windows 22h2 image i would like to see it for my work and to ensure my work is on a safe iso. scripts run best after w10privacy, blackbird, and oosu10. breaks webcams but not microphones. shortcuts can be created and copypaste occasionally works when between folders of two different drives. cant do internet changes or ipconfig really so make sure your net is set right before you do this. odin included for disk imaging, and nirsoft RegistryChangesView (Rcv.exe) to backup registry as most changes are done there. scripts fixed to run individually if something broke and you want to isolate the problem.

lowers input lag in FPS games drastically, reduces cpu to zero, breaks every moving thing windows has under its hood forever.
